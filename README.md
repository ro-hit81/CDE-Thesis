# Timber Logging Detection using Satellite Image Time Series  

This repository contains code, data processing workflows, and updates for my **Master's Thesis** on detecting timber-logged areas using **Sentinel-1 & Sentinel-2** satellite image time series.  

## 📌 Project Objectives  
- **Comparing DETER and ICV datasets** for logging detection  
- **Preprocessing & Analysis** of Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (Optical) data  
- **Developing AI/ML-based classification models** for detecting timber logging  
- **Evaluating forest degradation trends** over time  
- **Automating workflows for large-scale analysis**  

## 📂 Repository Structure 


## 🚀 Work in Progress  
This is an ongoing research project, and updates will be added regularly as the work progresses.
